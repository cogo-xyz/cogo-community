## Conclusion (Part 1)

This document covers the first four core agents of the COGO Agent Core system. Each agent is designed with specific responsibilities and capabilities, working together to provide a robust and scalable AI-powered development platform.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Loose Coupling**: Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped within agents
4. **Extensibility**: New agents can be easily added to the system
5. **Observability**: All agents provide comprehensive monitoring and logging

### Integration Patterns

1. **Event-Driven Communication**: Real-time messaging through Supabase
2. **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs for external integration
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph-based workflow management
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Centralized knowledge management system

For the remaining agents (Architecture Gateway, System Gateway, Indexing Worker, and Research Worker), please refer to Part 2 of this documentation.
