## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
```
├── Core Services
│   ├── CentralAPIKeyManager - API key management
│   ├── ServiceContainer - Dependency injection
│   ├── ConfigurationManagementService - System configuration
│   └── SupabaseRealtimeQueue - Real-time messaging
├── AI Services  
│   ├── AIClients - Multi-model AI integration
│   ├── BGEM3EmbeddingService - Vector embeddings
│   └── SupabaseRAGService - Knowledge retrieval
└── Knowledge Services
    ├── HybridKnowledgeManager - Knowledge coordination
    ├── RAGServiceFactory - RAG service access
    └── Knowledge graph integration (Neo4j ready)
```

### Agent Communication Flow
```
User Request → Orchestrator Agent → Decision Framework → Task Delegation → Target Agent(s) → Execution → Results → Orchestrator → User Response
```

### Real-time Event Flow
```
Agent Events → System Gateway → Event Filtering → Target Channels → Subscribed Agents → Response Actions
```

## Recent Development Work
