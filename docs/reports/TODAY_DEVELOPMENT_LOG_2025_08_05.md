# Today's Development Log - August 5, 2025

## Summary

Today's development focused on creating a comprehensive, enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System Test Suite for the COGO Agent Core. This involved designing and implementing a modular test framework, multiple storage backends, hybrid search capabilities, and real-time knowledge update systems.

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Comprehensive Test Framework Architecture**
- Designed and implemented a modular, extensible test framework (`RAGTestFramework.ts`)
- Created structured test suites for different aspects: initialization, core functionality, implementation, integration, performance, and real-time updates
- Implemented automated report generation (JSON and Markdown formats)
- Added performance metrics collection and analysis capabilities

### 2. **Multi-Storage Backend Implementation**
- **Supabase Vector Store**: Implemented vector embedding generation, storage, and similarity search using pgvector
- **Neo4j Graph Store**: Created graph-based knowledge storage with relationship management and graph search capabilities
- **Hybrid Search API**: Developed a unified interface that combines vector and graph search results using weighted fusion
- **Real-Time Knowledge Updater**: Built an event-driven system for real-time knowledge updates with batch processing and queue management

### 3. **Enterprise-Grade Features**
- **Mock Mode Support**: All components support mock mode for development without external dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and threshold monitoring
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allowing easy addition of new test cases and storage backends
