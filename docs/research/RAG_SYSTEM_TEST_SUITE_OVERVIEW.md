# RAG System Test Suite Overview

## Summary

This document describes the design, structure, and implementation details of the comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System Test Suite developed for the COGO project. The suite is designed to rigorously test all aspects of the RAG infrastructure, including Supabase vector storage, Neo4j graph storage, hybrid search API, and the real-time knowledge update system.

---

## 1. Motivation & Goals

- **Reliability**: Ensure all RAG components (vector, graph, hybrid, real-time) work as intended under various scenarios.
- **Maintainability**: Provide a modular, extensible, and well-documented test framework for future development and regression testing.
- **Performance**: Measure and optimize search, storage, and update operations for enterprise-scale workloads.
- **Automation**: Enable automated, repeatable, and report-generating test runs for CI/CD pipelines.

## 3. Main Components

### 3.1 Core Test Framework
- **RAGTestFramework.ts**: Orchestrates test suites, collects results, generates reports (JSON/Markdown), and provides performance metrics and recommendations.
- **RAGKnowledgeManager.ts**: Manages in-memory RAG knowledge, supports search, import/export, and statistics.

### 3.2 Implementations
- **SupabaseVectorStore.ts**: Handles vector embedding generation, storage, and similarity search using Supabase (pgvector). Includes mock mode for local testing.
- **Neo4jGraphStore.ts**: Manages knowledge as graph nodes and relationships in Neo4j. Supports graph-based search and relationship management. Includes mock mode.
- **HybridSearchAPI.ts**: Combines vector and graph search results using weighted fusion. Provides a unified hybrid search interface and knowledge storage.
- **RealTimeKnowledgeUpdater.ts**: Implements a real-time, event-driven knowledge update system with batch processing, queue management, and statistics.

### 3.3 Test Runner
- **run-all-tests.ts**: Runs all test suites in sequence: initialization, core functionality, implementation, integration, performance, and real-time update tests. Generates detailed reports.

---

## 4. Key Features

- **Modular Test Suites**: Each suite targets a specific aspect (initialization, core, implementation, integration, performance, real-time).
- **Mock Mode**: All storage/search layers support mock mode for development without external dependencies.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Reports include precision, recall, response time, throughput, and recommendations.
- **Batch & Real-Time Update**: Supports both batch and real-time knowledge updates with event-driven feedback.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new test cases, storage backends, or search strategies.

---

## 5. Usage

### Run All Tests
```bash
npx ts-node src/tests/rag-system/run-all-tests.ts
```

### Run Individual Suites
- See `README.md` for details on running specific modules or scenarios.

---

## 6. Development Notes

- All code is written in TypeScript and follows strict type safety and modularity principles.
- The framework is designed for both local development (mock mode) and integration with real Supabase/Neo4j backends.
- Reports are automatically generated in both JSON and Markdown formats for traceability and review.
- The system is ready for CI/CD integration and can be extended for future RAG-related features.

---

## 7. Next Steps / Recommendations

- Integrate with CI/CD for automated regression testing.
- Expand the knowledge base and add more complex, domain-specific test cases.
- Monitor and optimize performance for large-scale deployments.
- Add more advanced analytics and visualization to the reporting system.
